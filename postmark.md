# Postmark



* Emails can bounce for a variety of reasons. How would you explain to a customer the reason an email they sent through Postmark returned a soft bounce?



* A customer reached out to Postmark support asking about a feature we donâ€™t currently have \(and it's not coming up in the near future\). How would you handle that and what would you reply to them with?
  * Please also tell us a little about why you answered this way. What is your thought process behind it?



* Explain to a customer how to authenticate their domain with DKIM
  * Use our documentation in [http://postmarkapp.com/support/](https://postmarkapp.com/support) as a resource.
