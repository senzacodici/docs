1. On the ClinicSense dashboard, go to the **Setup** tab
2. Select the **Services** option
3. Select the service you would like to add clean-up time to
4. Add the desired additional time \(in minutes\)
5. Click **Save** to confirm the changes

Once you save the changes, any new appointment for that service will have the additional time included.

## Question \#3

* Hi! I have a client with two files, how can I combine them?

Hello Joan,

You can easily merge two customer files from the **Clients** menu. Let me show you with a simple use-case, where I merge "_Mike Connor_" and "_Michael Connor_" files:

1. On the dashboard, go to the **Clients** tab
2. Find the client with the duplicate record
3. Select the client file with the most complete data \(in my case, _Michael Connor_ will be used as the master file\)
4. Click on the **Gear button** next to the client's name
5. From the drop-down menu, select **Merge client**

![](.gitbook/assets/feaffac1-0e45-4c6f-89d2-e835d04718c0.png)

6. On the pop-up window, search for the duplicate client file \(in my case, _Mike Connor_\)  
7. Click on **Preview Merged File**  
8. Review the merged client file, and click on **Merge files** to confirm the changes

![](.gitbook/assets/d591b1aa-d67d-46aa-b984-732c1c521e1b.png)

Please note that the merged file will contain the _About_ and _Health History_ information from the client file you selected in Step 3 \(in my example, _Michael Connor_\) and _Appointments_ and _Payments_ from both client files.

## Question \#4

* I added a new practitioner to my account and I put in the wrong email address for her. Can you fix that on your end or do I fix it somehow?

Hello Peter,

Don't worry, you can correct the email address for your new practitioner from the **Practitioners** settings, and then resend the confirmation email so she can set up her account password. Let me guide you with an example:

1. From the dashboard, go to the **Setup** tab
2. Select the **Practitioners** option
3. From the drop-down menu, pick the practitioner you want to edit
4. Click on the **Account** tab
5. Edit the **Account Email**, with the new address
6. Click on **Save** to confirm the changes
7. Finally, click on **Resend Password** to allow the practitioner to set up the password

Please let me know if you were able to update the email address or if you need further assistance.

Have a nice day, best regards  
Damian

## Question \#5

* Could you advise if there is a way to set up a receptionist so they do not get emails about appointments? Our clinic director set up her accountant as a receptionist so she could have access to financial/revenue reports but she was getting appointments emails. Thanks in advance.

Hello Michael,

I understand the use-case, as your accountant doesn't need to get the appointment emails. This issue can be solved by changing the notification settings for her account, so she won't receive any appointment notifications.

I kindly ask you to forward these instructions to the clinic accountant, so she can edit her account:

1. Open the drop-down menu, by clicking on your email \(top-right\)
2. Select **My Notifications**

![](.gitbook/assets/5174f452-3d71-466a-a594-79e2f7250721.png)

3. De-select the checkboxes to stop receiving appointment notifications  
4. Click on **Save** to confirm the changes

![](.gitbook/assets/0ecc3501-5a40-4664-b5f0-c05fa17c2e2e.png)

Once the accountant saves the changes, she shouldn't receive any appointment emails.  
Please let me know if you have further questions.

Have a nice day, best regards  
Damian

## Question \#6

* I work in a clinic where there are about six of us using ClinicSense. In my settings, I put my services to book online, but the problem is that clients could then start cancelling online. How can I deactivate the cancel online portion?

Hello Claire,

I understand the issue, you want to keep the online booking feature available, while disabling the option for online cancellation. This can be achieved by editing the scheduling settings on the clinic setup. Let me show you how to edit the settings with this quick guide:

1. Click on the **Setup** tab
2. Select the **Scheduling Settings** option
3. Click on the **Scheduling Rules** tab
4. On the first drop-down box, choose **Never** \(clients can't cancel appointments online\)
5. Click on **Save** to confirm the changes

![](.gitbook/assets/6.png)

After you save the changes, your customers won't be allowed to cancel appointments online.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

Have a nice day, best regards  
Damian

## Question \#7

1. On the dashboard, click on the **Setup** tab
2. Select the **Practitioners** option
3. Choose the practitioner you want to edit from the drop-down menu
4. Click on the **Account** tab
