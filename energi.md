> “What similarities do the crypto projects with the strongest communities \(e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Energi, Ripple, Chainlink, etc.\) all have in common? What is the importance/advantages of having such a large, passionate community?”

## Communities & Crypto projects

Bitcoin's whitepaper opened the doors to the blockchain era, where hundreds of companies and startups began to develop their crypto projects. After the original hype, we have seen some succeeding and others falling into oblivion. 

Today, in a crypto space saturated with projects everywhere, communities have a key role in making a project stand above the crowd.

When we take successful projects like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Energi, beyond any technical difference \(like using PoW or PoS\), we can see that they all have a common point: strong communities and supporters.

If we look further, supporters get attracted because these crypto projects have:

* an open-source technology \(anyone can review the code and propose changes\)
* a working and live network \(no vaporware\)
* years on the market \(they're well established\)
* a vision to improve people's lives through the digital economy \(social impact\)

Like in a virtuous circle, a growing community base makes the crypto-project stronger, and in return, a bigger crypto-technology draws more supporters to it.

Don't be fooled, these tech communities are not just a _dull fanbase;_ they bring true value to the blockchain space. They have knowledge and ideas that they discuss in an open environment, and this feedback, in turn, can re-shape the project's features and capabilities. \(As a well-known example, Ethereum was born from Vitalik Buterin's debates among the Bitcoin community\)  

Thriving projects must bring real value to real people, as they are not just some theoretical equations on a paper. Having large, passionate supporters is also proof of that, as it means that its technology is a fertile ground to build new endeavors.

Imagine, for example, that a developer needs to choose a technology for his dApp or Smart Contract. A significant part of that decision will be made based on the community that backs it up. You probably won't make a dApp in a technology that nobody uses, or where there's no developer community where you can ask questions or discuss how to build your application.

As we have examined, having an active community is an important asset for crypto projects. Not only as users who could buy or trade its coins but also as advocates who discuss and bring new ideas to the table. This strong base of supporters enables the projects to succeed in a crowded landscape where everyone wants to catch the blockchain's spotlight.
